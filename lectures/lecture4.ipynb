    "# Example 1: Write a Function to Find the Reverse Complement of a DNA Sequence\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, you will write a Python function that takes a DNA sequence as input and returns its **reverse complement**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What Is the Reverse Complement?\n",
    "\n",
    "The **reverse complement** of a DNA sequence is formed by two steps:\n",
    "1. **Complement**: Replace each nucleotide with its complement:\n",
    "    - `A` (adenine) → `T` (thymine)\n",
    "    - `T` (thymine) → `A` (adenine)\n",
    "    - `C` (cytosine) → `G` (guanine)\n",
    "    - `G` (guanine) → `C` (cytosine)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Reverse**: Reverse the order of the complemented sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example:\n",
    "Original Sequence:  \n",
    "`ATGC`\n",
    "\n",
    "Complement:  \n",

    "\n",
    "Reverse Complement:  \n",
    "`GCAT`\n",
    "\n",
    "## Task\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Write a function named `reverse_complement` that:\n",
    "   - Accepts a DNA sequence as input.\n",
    "   - Returns its reverse complement.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Write test cases for your function to make sure it works as expected.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Read the DNA sequence from a **FASTA file** named `Ecoli_genome.fasta`. Assume the file contains a valid DNA sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Let's spend some time thinking about the number of operations it took to generate the reverse complement for a given DNA sequence of length n. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Steps to Implement:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Parse the FASTA File**:\n",
    "   Use Python to open and read the `Ecoli_genome.fasta` file. Skip the header line (starting with `>`), and extract the sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Write the Function**:\n",
    "   Define the `reverse_complement` function to compute the reverse complement of the sequence.\n",

    "   Print the reverse complement of the sequence read from the FASTA file.\n",

    "\n",
    "## What Are Classes and Instances?\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, a **class** is a blueprint for creating objects. Objects are instances of classes, and they encapsulate data (attributes) and behaviors (methods). Classes are important because they help organize and structure your code around real-world entities.\n",
