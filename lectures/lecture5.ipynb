    "## **What are Libraries in Python?**\n",
    "Libraries in Python are collections of pre-written code that provide functionality for performing specific tasks, such as numerical computation, data visualization, or web development. By using libraries, you can avoid writing code from scratch and save time while benefiting from optimized, well-tested solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Libraries are usually imported at the beginning of your Python script or notebook using the `import` statement. For example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import numpy as np\n",
    "import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n",
    "```\n",
    "Here, `numpy` is imported with the alias `np`, and `matplotlib.pyplot` is imported as `plt` for convenience and readability.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **NumPy**: \n",
    "NumPy (short for Numerical Python) is a powerful library for numerical computing in Python. It provides support for working with arrays, matrices, and high-level mathematical functions to perform operations on these data structures. NumPy is essential for scientific computing, enabling efficient manipulation of large datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "To use NumPy in your Python programs, it must first be imported. By convention, it is typically imported as `np` for brevity:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import numpy as np\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Matplotlib**:\n",
    "Matplotlib is a comprehensive library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python. It allows you to create a wide variety of plots such as line plots, bar charts, histograms, scatter plots, and more. A common submodule used for plotting is `pyplot`, which is conventionally imported as `plt`:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "With Matplotlib, you can visualize your data and make your analyses more understandable.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **User-Defined Functions**:\n",
    "In Python, you can define your own functions to modularize and reuse code. A user-defined function is written using the `def` keyword and can be stored in a Python file (with a `.py` extension). This makes it reusable across different scripts or projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s an example of a Python file (`my_functions.py`) with a user-defined function:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# my_functions.py\n",
    "def greet(name):\n",
    "    return f\"Hello, {name}!\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can then import and use this function in your program:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from my_functions import greet\n",
    "\n",
    "message = greet(\"Class\")\n",
    "print(message)  # Output: Hello, Class!\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Points:\n",
    "1. Libraries like NumPy and Matplotlib must be imported to use their functionality.\n",
    "2. User-defined functions help you create reusable, modular code.\n",
    "3. Use import statements to bring external libraries and functions from other files into your script.\n"
