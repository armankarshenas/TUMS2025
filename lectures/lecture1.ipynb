    "\n",
    "Hi, I’m **Arman Karshenas**, and I’ll be your instructor for the first and last sections of the course. I completed my BA at the University of Oxford followed by an MPhil from the University of Cambridge. I recently finished my PhD in Biophysics at UC Berkeley, where my research focuses on using machine learning and computational methods to solve complex biological problems. I’ve taught programming and bioinformatics courses and led initiatives to make these skills accessible to students globally. I am passionate about bridging the gap between computational techniques and medical research, and I’m excited to share my knowledge with you.\n",

    "Please kindly note the following: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. The first section consist of 6 lectures in total and we will be going over the basics of programming in Python. If we have time, I might try to sqeeze in some R for those of you who are interested in doing more stats in the future.\n",
    "2. The classes are scheduled to run from 7-10 PM Tehran time and we will meet on Zoom using the following link [https://berkeley.zoom.us/my/karshenas](https://berkeley.zoom.us/my/karshenas)\n",
    "3. The class is hands-on with a lot of examples to help you better understand and I encourage everyone to raise their hands on Zoom and interrupt me to ask questions at any point during the class.\n",
    "4. All the course materials are going to be in English - I think it is good practice to learn the formal and proper words and vocabulary of the areas we are going to cover. Please do interrupt me or send me a message if you are struggling with this. \n",
    "5. I will be publishing course materials and HWs in Jupyter notebook format. You have the option to use [Jupyter labs](https://jupyter.org/install) or [Google colab](https://colab.research.google.com) to work with these notebooks (more on the setup later). \n",
    "6. Each class is accompanied by a HW that is there for you to try different and harder problems.\n",
    "7. I will try to post readings and resources regarding each major topic that we introduce in the course so that you can refer to them later if you are interested.\n",

    "- **Null Hypothesis ($H_0$):** Drug A has no effect on blood pressure (the mean blood pressure in the treatment and control groups is the same).\n",
    "- **Alternative Hypothesis ($H_1$):** Drug A reduces blood pressure (the mean blood pressure in the treatment group is lower than in the control group).\n",

    "- **Example:** Due to random variation, we observe a significant decrease in blood pressure in the treatment group, but this effect is not truly caused by the drug.\n",
    "- **Probability:** Denoted by $\\alpha$, typically set at 0.05 (5%).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Type II Error (False Negative)\n",
    "- **Definition:** Failing to detect that Drug A reduces blood pressure when it actually does.\n",
    "- **Example:** Insufficient sample size or high variability leads to an inability to observe a statistically significant difference.\n",
    "- **Probability:** Denoted by $\\beta$.\n",

    "The power of the test is $1 - \\beta$, representing the probability of correctly detecting that Drug A reduces blood pressure. A higher power increases confidence in the test results.\n",

    "- **Large p-value (e.g., $\\geq 0.05$):** Insufficient evidence to conclude that Drug A is effective.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Role of Sample Size in Testing Drug A\n",
    "\n",
    "### Larger Sample Sizes\n",

    "- Increase the precision of the estimated effect of Drug A.\n",
    "- Enhance the power of the test to detect a true effect.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Smaller Sample Sizes\n",
    "- Increase the likelihood of a Type II error, potentially missing the true effect of Drug A.\n",
    "- Lead to less reliable conclusions.\n",

    "\n",
    "## Bias and Its Impact\n",
    "\n",
    "### Selection Bias\n",
    "If the treatment and control groups are not randomly assigned, differences in blood pressure could be attributed to factors other than Drug A.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Measurement Bias\n",
    "Inaccurate or inconsistent blood pressure measurements can obscure the true effect of the drug.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Confounding Bias\n",
    "Variables like age, weight, or baseline health conditions could influence blood pressure and confound the observed effect of Drug A.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Power Analysis for Drug A\n",
    "\n",
    "If we hypothesize that Drug A reduces blood pressure by 5 mmHg with a standard deviation of 10 mmHg, and we want 80% power to detect this difference at $\\alpha = 0.05$, power analysis can help determine the required sample size.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Calculation\n",
    "For a two-sample t-test:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "n = \\frac{(Z_{\\alpha/2} + Z_\\beta)^2 \\cdot 2\\sigma^2}{\\Delta^2}\n",

    "- $Z_{\\alpha/2}$ is the critical value for the significance level.\n",
    "- $Z_\\beta$ is the critical value for the desired power.\n",
    "- $\\sigma$ is the standard deviation (10 mmHg in this example).\n",
    "- $\\Delta$ is the expected difference (5 mmHg).\n",
    "\n",
    "This ensures the study is adequately powered to detect the effect of Drug A on blood pressure.\n",

    "## Variable Types and Type Checking\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, variables are **dynamically typed**, meaning you don’t need to declare their type explicitly. Python will infer the type based on the value.\n",
    "\n",
    "To check the type of a variable:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "x = 10\n",
    "print(type(x))  # Output: <class 'int'>\n",
    "\n",
    "y = \"Hello\"\n",
    "print(type(y))  # Output: <class 'str'>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Things Beginners Need to Know\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Reassigning Variables**: You can change the value of a variable at any time.\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   x = 5\n",
    "   x = \"Now I'm a string!\"\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Input and Output**:\n",
    "   - Use `input()` to get user input.\n",
    "   - Use `print()` to display output.\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   name = input(\"Enter your name: \")\n",
    "   print(\"Hello, \" + name + \"!\")\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Common Errors**:\n",
    "   - Using a variable before it is defined:\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     print(x)  # NameError: name 'x' is not defined\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "   - Mismatched operations (e.g., adding a string to a number):\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     result = \"Age: \" + 25  # TypeError: can only concatenate str (not \"int\") to str\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Best Practices**:\n",
    "   - Use meaningful variable names to make your code easier to read.\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     # Bad\n",
    "     a = 25\n",
    "\n",
    "     # Good\n",
    "     age = 25\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "With these basics, you're ready to start working with variables in Python!\n"
