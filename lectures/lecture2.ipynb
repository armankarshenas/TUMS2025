    "# Conditional Statements in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Conditional statements are used to execute a block of code based on certain conditions. They allow your program to make decisions and branch execution paths depending on the evaluation of expressions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Types of Conditional Statements\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **`if` Statement**\n",
    "The `if` statement is used to test a condition. If the condition evaluates to `True`, the block of code inside the `if` statement is executed.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Example\n",
    "age = 20\n",
    "if age >= 18:\n",
    "    print(\"You are eligible to vote.\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **`if-else` Statement**\n",
    "The `if-else` statement allows you to define an alternative block of code to run when the condition evaluates to `False`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Example\n",
    "age = 16\n",
    "if age >= 18:\n",
    "    print(\"You are eligible to vote.\")\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    print(\"You are not eligible to vote.\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **`if-elif-else` Statement**\n",
    "The `if-elif-else` statement is used when you have multiple conditions to check. The first condition that evaluates to `True` will execute its block of code, and the rest will be ignored.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Example\n",
    "grade = 85\n",
    "if grade >= 90:\n",
    "    print(\"A\")\n",
    "elif grade >= 80:\n",
    "    print(\"B\")\n",
    "elif grade >= 70:\n",
    "    print(\"C\")\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    print(\"F\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **Nested `if` Statements**\n",
    "You can nest one `if` statement inside another to check more complex conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Example\n",
    "age = 25\n",
    "citizen = True\n",
    "if age >= 18:\n",
    "    if citizen:\n",
    "        print(\"You can vote.\")\n",
    "    else:\n",
    "        print(\"You need to be a citizen to vote.\")\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    print(\"You are too young to vote.\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Logical Operators in Conditions\n",
    "Conditional statements often use logical operators to combine or modify conditions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`and`**: Returns `True` if both conditions are `True`.\n",
    "- **`or`**: Returns `True` if at least one condition is `True`.\n",
    "- **`not`**: Inverts the boolean value of the condition.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example with Logical Operators\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Example\n",
    "age = 19\n",
    "has_ID = True\n",
    "if age >= 18 and has_ID:\n",
    "    print(\"You can enter.\")\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    print(\"You cannot enter.\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Points to Remember\n",
    "- **Indentation is critical in Python to define blocks of code.**\n",
    "- Conditions must evaluate to a boolean value (`True` or `False`).\n",
    "- Use `elif` to test multiple conditions, but only one block will execute.\n",
    "- Logical operators help build complex conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conditional statements are fundamental for controlling the flow of your program, making them an essential concept to master!\n"

    "# Example 4: Calculating Allele Frequency from a 2D List of Sequences\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, we will compute the **allele frequency** of the dominant allele from a list of DNA sequences. Each sequence contains nucleotides (`A`, `T`, `C`, `G`), and the sequences are provided in a 2D list.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objectives\n",
    "1. **Access individual bases** from the sequences stored in the 2D list.\n",
    "2. **Count occurrences** of each nucleotide across all sequences.\n",
    "3. Compute and **print the percentage** of each nucleotide.\n",
    "4. **Use NumPy** to find the dominant allele.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Input\n",
    "```python\n",
    "sequences = [\n",
    "    [\"A\", \"T\", \"G\", \"G\"],\n",
    "    [\"A\", \"A\", \"T\", \"G\"],\n",
    "    [\"C\", \"A\", \"G\", \"G\"],\n",
    "    [\"T\", \"A\", \"C\", \"G\"]\n",
    "]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Expected Output\n",
    "```\n",
    "Dominant Allele: A - 50%\n",
    "Dominant Allele: A - 75%\n",
    "Dominant Allele: C - 25%\n",
    "Dominant Allele: G - 100%\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Points\n",
    "1. **Accessing elements in 2D lists:**\n",
    "   - Use `sequences[row][column]` to access individual bases.\n",
    "   - Example: `sequences[0][0]` gives `\"A\"` (first row, first column).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Nested loops:**\n",
    "   - Outer loop iterates through each sequence (row).\n",
    "   - Inner loop iterates through each base in the sequence (column).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Percentage calculation:**\n",
    "   - Use the formula:\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     frequency = (count / total_bases) * 100\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Using NumPy for advanced operations:**\n",
    "   - Use `max` with a dictionary to find the key with the highest value.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Challenge\n",
    "Modify the program to:\n",
    "- Handle sequences of different lengths.\n",
    "- Print the most frequent nucleotide.\n"
