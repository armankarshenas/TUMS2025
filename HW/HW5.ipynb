    "## Problem 1: Transcription of DNA to RNA\n",
    "Write a method in the `Sequence` class to perform **transcription**, converting a DNA sequence to RNA.  \n",
    "- Replace all occurrences of `T` with `U`.  \n",
    "- Ensure the method raises an error if called on an RNA sequence.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Task:\n",
    "Given the DNA sequence `ATGCATGC`, transcribe it into RNA. Test your method with invalid input (an RNA sequence).\n",

    "## Problem 2: Finding CpG Islands\n",
    "In a DNA sequence, **CpG islands** are regions with high occurrences of the \"CG\" dinucleotide. These are important in gene regulation. Write a function to identify all CpG islands in a given sequence. A CpG island is defined as:\n",
    "1. At least 200 base pairs long.\n",
    "2. A GC content of 50% or higher.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task:\n",
    "Given the sequence:\n",
    "```plaintext\n",
    "ATGCGCGTAGCGCGCGCATGCGCGTAGCGTATGCGCGTAGCGCGCGT\n",
    "```\n",
    "Find and return the start and end positions of all CpG islands.\n",

    "## Problem 3: Analyzing Mutations in Patient Data\n",
    "You are given a FASTA file, `mutations.fasta`, containing sequences from cancer patients. Write a script to:\n",
    "1. Read the sequences from the file.\n",
    "2. Identify whether each sequence contains a **specific mutation** (e.g., the substitution `ATC â†’ GGC`).\n",
    "3. Print a report of patient IDs (from the FASTA headers) and whether the mutation was found.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Challenge:\n",
    "Enhance your script to find multiple mutations and output the results in a tabular format.\n",

    "## Problem 4: Protein Translation\n",
    "Extend the `Sequence` class with a `translate` method that translates an RNA sequence into a protein. Use the standard genetic code table for the mapping:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "genetic_code = {\n",
    "    'AUG': 'M', 'UUU': 'F', 'UUC': 'F', 'UUA': 'L', 'UUG': 'L', ...\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task:\n",
    "Given the RNA sequence `AUGUUUUAA`, translate it into a protein sequence. Handle stop codons (`UAA`, `UAG`, `UGA`) appropriately.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem 5: Sequence Comparison for Drug Resistance\n",
    "Drug resistance in pathogens often results from mutations in DNA or RNA sequences. Write a function that:\n",
    "1. Accepts two sequences of equal length.\n",
    "2. Calculates the **Hamming distance** between them (the number of differing bases).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task:\n",
    "Compare the following sequences and determine if the pathogen is resistant (Hamming distance > 3):  \n",
    "```plaintext\n",
    "Sequence 1: ATGCGTAGC  \n",
    "Sequence 2: ATCCGTAGT\n",
    "```\n",

    "These problems provide a mix of coding challenges that apply to real-world problems in bioinformatics and medicine, encouraging students to think critically and use Python effectively.\n"
